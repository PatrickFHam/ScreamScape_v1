You can find Springs Taproom located in the Bird Gardens area of the park, with a pond and nice landscaping nearby making it a great place to sit and relax for a bit. The new Taproom replaces the old Garden Gate Cafe, which was an evolution of the park’s former Hospitality House structure from when the park first opened under Anheuser-Busch.",

  "body": "Due to some family medical issues that were taking place at the time, I still can’t believe I forgot to post that Kennywood announced their new ride for 2023 would be called SPINVASION! They say that Spinvasion will be the first ride of its kind in the United States and located into a new 'alien themed' revamped section of the park that they are calling Area 412. According to Kennywood’s General Manager Mark Pauls, 'This extra-terrestrial thrill ride is the centerpiece of the all-new alien-inspired Area 412 section of the park. Featuring a massive themed ride backdrop, along with a fresh new look to the Cosmic Chaos and an improved retail shop, this is one giant leap for all Kennywood fans and Season Passholders.'  Spinvasion casts you as daring pilots in the middle of the Battle for the ‘Burgh. 'Riders will strap into their solo manned aircraft and prepare for a classic swing experience after takeoff. Next-level fun quickly begins by crisscrossing with other pilots, flying sideways at certain points parallel to the ground. Spinvasion thrills with every revolution while gliding along the giant waves. The illusion of close encounters with the rider in front fuels the excitement and energy while in flight. The whole experience is enhanced by a spectacular, colorful light display that makes riders feel as if they’ve entered the fourth dimension.'",

To be located inside the massive new structure built up at the backside of Fireman’s Landing is expected to be a modern style replacement for the park’s Fire in the Hole dark ride coaster experience.  RMC’s involvement isn’t a surprise however, as I believe RMC has been involved with providing new track pieces during off-season refurbishments to the existing Fire in the Hole and sister-ride, Blazing Fury at Dollywood, for the past several years.",
